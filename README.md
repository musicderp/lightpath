# LightPath CDN Nginx Module
Version: 1.0.0-beta

## Notice: Rework In Progress
I'm currently working on making this project more user friendly. There is a list of upcoming features below!

You can view progress in the "dev" branch and projects dashboard "beta". All new code will remain opensource as always.

Upcoming Features:
* Server cluster management
* Dashboard & API
* Analytics via Clickhouse and Kafka
* Load balancing
* Automatic SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
* Web Application Firewall with ModSecurity ruleset support
* Rate limiting
* Captcha Support (Hcaptcha, Recaptcha, Geetest)
* Custom block pages
* Javascript bot verification
* DNS management via third party services


## Description
CDN, content delivery network, written in Lua using Openresty (Nginx). Website configurations (backend, cache rules, edge rules, etc) are stored in Redis.

If there is interest I will add proper documentation in the future. This project was made public because I don't personally have the time and money to make this into an actual company. A docker file is provided so you can build this into a docker image.

## Note
There is one software that is not included called Ambassador. Ambassador is a custom SSL certificate manager modeled after Netflix's Lemur. You can easily replace it for Lemur in the `ssl.lua` file.

The module also makes heavy usage of Hashicorp Vault to store secret keys for Ambassador and the JWT token which is used to authenticate to the cache purge api. If you are unable to modify the source code to bypass these requirements, open an issue and I'll try my best to work with you.
